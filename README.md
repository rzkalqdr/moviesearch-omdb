# moviesearch-omdb
 
Simple movie searching service utilizing the [Open Movie Database RESTful API](https://omdbapi.com/). The whole thing is built from the ground-up following [this very tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvOFqREy7A8) (hence the layout being very similar) in attempt to familiarize myself with using public APIs and jQuery, with small changes and knick-knacks for my liking.

## Pre-requisites
- XAMPP Local Server
- OMDB API key
